# Task 1: Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)

## 📋 Description
Implements a simple feedforward neural network for classification using NumPy. Includes training on a sample dataset (e.g., Iris) and visualizes performance.

## 📁 Files Included
- `neural_network.py` – Neural network implementation
- `train_and_run.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook for training and testing
- `example_input.csv` – Sample input dataset

## ⚙️ Installation
Install required packages:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
▶️ How to Run
Option 1: Using Notebook

jupyter notebook train_and_run.ipynb
Option 2: Using Python Script
(If neural_network.py is runnable directly)

neural_network.py
