Task 3: Time Series Transformation Benchmark Report
📌 Overview
This task benchmarks different implementations of a simple moving average function on synthetic time series data. The goal is to evaluate performance trade-offs, memory usage, and best practices using:

NumPy

pandas

NumExpr

Numba

⚙️ Implementations Compared
Method	Description
NumPy	Basic convolution using np.convolve
pandas	Window function using rolling().mean()
NumExpr	Expression evaluation engine (loop-based)
Numba (JIT)	JIT-accelerated mean over sliding window

🧪 Performance Summary
Method	Execution Time (ms)	Memory Usage	Notes
NumPy	~15 ms	Low	Fast, native, lacks parallelism
pandas	~20 ms	Medium	Easy to use, but more overhead
NumExpr	~80 ms	Medium	Slower due to loop + eval overhead
Numba	~5 ms	Low	Fastest for large arrays

(Replace these numbers with actual values from your benchmark_result.ipynb output.)

📈 Memory Footprint
All methods use minimal additional memory. Numba and NumPy are most efficient as they avoid object overhead seen in pandas.

✅ Best Practices
Use Numba for CPU-intensive numeric operations in tight loops.

Prefer pandas for ease of use when working with DataFrames.

Avoid NumExpr for moving averages; better suited for vectorized math expressions.

Benchmark your code when working with time-sensitive data pipelines.

## 🧠 Recommended Practices

- Use **NumPy** for small to medium data and when code simplicity matters.
- Use **Pandas** for quick prototyping or when working in a DataFrame context.
- Use **NumExpr** when you want faster arithmetic on large arrays and avoid loops.
- Use **Numba** for large-scale numeric tasks or when looping is unavoidable.

---

## 📎 Future Improvements

- Support for exponential moving averages.
- GPU acceleration via CuPy or RAPIDS.
- Memory profiling for large batches.
