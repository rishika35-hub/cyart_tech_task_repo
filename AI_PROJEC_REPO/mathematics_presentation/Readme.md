# 📊 Mathematics Presentations – Linear Algebra & Calculus

This folder contains two complete mathematics presentation decks prepared as part of an AI academic project. Each deck includes:

- Definitions
- Key theorems
- Illustrative examples
- One worked-out problem
- Python/NumPy demo (optional, not included here)

These presentations are based on the popular 3Blue1Brown YouTube series and supported by standard textbooks.
